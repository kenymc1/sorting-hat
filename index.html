          <h1 class="text-center">About The School</h1>
          Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards
          and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena
          Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect of
          personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. However,
          shortly after founding the school, Slytherin had a falling out with
          the other founders about blood purity, and wanted to admit only
          pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn
          magic, and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and
          Half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed,
          especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school, but not before
          secretly building the Chamber of Secrets. He foretold that only his
          own heir would be able to open it once he or she arrived at the
          school, and the heir would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside
          to purge the school of all Muggle-born students.

        <h1 class="text-center">Gryffindor</h1>
        <p>
          Gryffindor values courage, bravery, nerve, and chivalry. Gryffindor's
          mascot is the lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. During the
          books, the Head of this house is the Transfiguration Professor and
          Deputy Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall until she becomes
          headmistress, and the house ghost is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington,
          more commonly known as Nearly Headless Nick. According to Rowling,
          Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire. The founder of
          the house is Godric Gryffindor. The Gryffindor common room is in one
          of the castle's highest towers, and its entrance is on the seventh
          floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a painting of
          The Fat Lady, who is garbed in a pink dress. She permits entry only
          after being given the correct password, as was established in the
          third book, when Sirius Black tried forcing entry into the tower, only
          to be blocked by The Fat Lady after he could not give the correct
          password. In the first book, Neville Longbottom tends to forget the
          password and must wait near the painting until other Gryffindors
          arrive to open the way.[23]

    <section id="Hufflepuff">
      <div class="Hufflepuff">
        <img src="/img/_0000_Hufflepuff.png" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="" />
        <h1 class="text-center">Hufflepuff</h1>
        <p>
          Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house
          mascot is the badger, and canary yellow and black are its colours.
          During the books, the Head of this house is the Herbology Professor
          Pomona Sprout, and the house ghost is the Fat Friar. According to
          Rowling, Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth. The
          founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff. e entrance to the
          Hufflepuff dormitories and common room entrance is concealed in a pile
          of large barrels in an alcove in the corridor that holds the kitchen.
          To enter, one must tap the barrel two from the bottom in the middle of
          the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff". Unlike any other
          house, the Hufflepuff common room has a repelling device that douses
          the illegal entrant in vinegar if the wrong lid is tapped or the
          rhythm is wrong.[24] The Hufflepuff common room is filled with yellow
          hangings and fat armchairs and it has little tunnels leading to the
          dormitories, all of which have perfectly round doors, like barrel
          tops.[25]

    <section id="Ravenclaw">
      <div class="Ravenclaw">
        <img src="/img/_0001_Ravenclaw.png" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="" />
        <h1 class="text-center">Ravenclaw</h1>
        <p>
          Ravenclaw values intelligence, creativity, learning, and
          wit.[HP5][HP7] The house mascot is an eagle and the house colours are
          blue and bronze (blue and silver in the films). During the books, the
          head of this house is the Charms teacher, Professor Filius Flitwick,
          and the house ghost is the Grey Lady. According to Rowling, Ravenclaw
          corresponds roughly to the element of air. The founder of this house
          is Rowena Ravenclaw. The dormitories are in Ravenclaw Tower, on the
          west side of Hogwarts. The common room is round and filled with blue
          hangings and armchairs, has a domed ceiling painted with stars and
          features a replica statue of Rowena wearing her diadem. Harry also
          notes that Ravenclaws "have a spectacular view of the surrounding
          mountains". A logical riddle must be solved to gain entry, whereas the
          Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms only require a password
          (Hufflepuffs need to tap a barrel in the rhythm of "Helga
          Hufflepuff"), indicating that it may be easier for those students from
          other houses who possess a high degree of intelligence to enter this
          common room than others. Professor McGonagall, the head of the
          Gryffindor House, solves the riddle accurately
        </p>

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Slytherin -->
    <section id="Slytherin">
      <div class="Slytherin">
        <img src="/img/_0002_Slytherin.png" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="" />
        <h1 class="text-center">Slytherin</h1>
        <p>
          Slytherin values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness;
          the Sorting Hat said in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone that
          Slytherins will do anything to get their way. The house mascot of
          Slytherin is the serpent, and the house colours are green and silver.
          Throughout the series, until the seventh book, the Head of House is
          Professor Severus Snape. Then, the previous Head of House Professor
          Horace Slughorn comes out of retirement, re-assuming authority after
          Snape becomes headmaster. The ghost of Slytherin house is The Bloody
          Baron.[26] According to Rowling, Slytherin corresponds roughly to the
          element of water. The founder of this house is Salazar Slytherin. The
          Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached by speaking a
          password to a patch of bare stone wall in the dungeons, which causes a
          hidden door to open. The Slytherin common room is a long, low,
          dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green
          lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described in the second book
          as having a greenish glow. The Sorting Hat claims that blood purity is
          a factor in selecting Slytherins, although this is not mentioned until
          the fifth book. There is no reason to believe, however, that
          Muggle-born students are not sorted there, merely that pure-blooded
          students are more desirable to that house, as there are several
          examples of half-bloods in the house - such as Snape, Tom
          Riddle/Voldemort and Harry himself was only excluded from the house at
          his own insistence. In Deathly Hallows, a group of Snatchers claim
          that "not many Mudbloods" are sorted into Slytherin. When believing
          Harry to be dead and thinking that he has final victory in his grasp,
          Voldemort proclaims his intention to abolish the other three houses
          and force all Hogwarts students into Slytherin. This design is foiled
          by his defeat and death, after which Slytherin becomes more diluted in
          its blood purity, no longer remaining the pure-blood bastion it once
          was.
